# Quest Hackey BSR/Twitch integration

This is a simple irc bot that handles basic beat saber song requests. It 
works by creating a list of requested songs, then once the streamer is 
ready, will create a .bplist (beat saber playlist) that can easily be 
uploaded to bmbf.

Currently bplists are not implemented and I am not sure when I will be implementing them. For now, I will just dump the songs into a folder.
